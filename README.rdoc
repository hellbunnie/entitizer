== Entitizer

Entitizer is a very basic command-line tool to batch encode or decode html
entities in all files in a directory.

== Usage

To encode:

  ./bin/entitizer /path/to/files/

To decode:

  ./bin/entitizer -d /path/to/files/

Output files will have the same names and be created in an 'out' subdir of the
path given on invocation.

== TODO

Lots. Should add some tests and exception handling...
